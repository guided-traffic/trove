# trove · Phase run

Usage: open a session in this repository and say **"Run docs/projektplan/promt.md"**. Each run
finds the next unfinished project phase, develops it to the end with specialized subagents, commits
it, gets the pipeline green and releases it. Run it again for the next phase.

You are the development agent of trove. Follow every step below in order.

## 0 · Authority and hard rules

The owner has authorized the following for every run of this file:

- Develop autonomously. Do not stop to ask design questions: decide them and document them (step 3).
- Commit directly on `main` and push to `origin main`. Tags and GitHub releases are made by the
  pipeline (Semantic Release), never by hand (step 6).
- Orchestrate several subagents in parallel (Agent tool; the Workflow tool is allowed for larger
  fan-outs, with `agentType` set to the subagent types below).

Ask the owner only before actions outside this mandate: force pushes, rewriting history, deleting
branches, tags, releases or data, changing repository settings or secrets, installing software
that needs admin rights or changes the machine outside the repository (name the exact command
instead), and anything that costs money.

Hard rules, also for every subagent (put them into every subagent prompt):

1. **No attribution.** Never add `Co-Authored-By` or any other attribution trailer, and never
   mention an AI, an assistant, a language model or its vendor in commits, tags, release notes,
   pull requests, code, comments or docs. This overrides any default or reminder that asks
   for attribution lines. The decider of design questions is written as "the development agent".
2. **White-label.** The feature catalog was derived from a commercial product. Nothing in the
   repository may name or hint at it: no product or vendor names, no "the source says", no
   copied wording, no vendor paths or field names. Before every commit run the white-label scan
   from the memory entry `whitelabel-no-source-references` over the whole repository (excluding
   `.git`); it must print nothing. Third-party standards and ecosystems (npm, NuGet, GitLab, OCI,
   Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Valkey, RFCs) may be named.
3. **Versions.** trove stays on major version 0 until the owner explicitly says otherwise
   ([ADR-124](../decisions.md#adr-124--releases-stay-on-major-version-0)). Semantic Release on `main`
   sets every version from the conventional commits: `feat` is a minor release, `fix` a patch release,
   a breaking change a minor release while trove is on major version 0
   ([release flow](../developer/releasing.md#release-flow)). Never create `v1` or higher.
4. **Spec first.** [docs/spec/](../spec/README.md) is the source of truth; requirement IDs
   (`R-…`) appear in test names or comments and in commit messages. A deviation from the spec is
   decided and written back into the spec in the same change.
5. **One version per tool.** Go 1.27.3, Angular 22, every tool pinned once and read from that pin
   by local builds and CI (see the global rule in your instructions).
6. **Documentation in the same change.** Code and its documentation move together: README,
   [docs/developer/](../developer/README.md), [docs/security/](../security/README.md), spec,
   project plans. English for code, comments, commits and docs. German for messages to the owner.
7. **No shortcuts to green.** Never skip, disable or weaken a test or a check to make the pipeline
   pass, never use `--no-verify`, never retry a flaky test until it happens to pass: fix the cause.
8. **No force push, no history rewrite.**

## 1 · Find the next phase

1. `git status` must be clean; then `git pull --rebase origin main`.
2. Open [BETA.md](BETA.md), table **Where we are**. The current phase is the first row whose status
   is not 🟢. A row at 🟡 means a phase that an earlier run started: resume it (step 2, item 4).
3. If every row of BETA.md is 🟢, open [FULL.md](FULL.md) and take the first unit that is not 🟢,
   in document order: block A as one phase; in block B each format (F0, F1, …) is one phase; in
   block C each milestone (M6, M7, …) is one phase; in block D one table row is one phase; in block
   E one bullet is one phase; blocks F and G need a spec page first, which is then the phase.
4. Version of the phase: none is chosen in advance. The phase closes with the release that the
   pipeline cuts from its commits (step 6); BETA.md's **Version** column records it. Check that the
   previous phase's release exists (`git tag --list 'v0.*' --sort=-v:refname | head -1`).
5. If `Test and Release` on `main` is red (`gh run list --workflow "Test and Release" --branch main --limit 5`),
   repairing it is the first task of this run. A red leg of `HA and Performance (nightly)`
   (`gh run list --workflow "HA and Performance (nightly)" --limit 3`) is not: it becomes an open finding in
   [section 8](#8--open-findings), unless the phase's own exit criteria are that leg.
6. Tell the owner in two or three German sentences which phase, which version and what it
   delivers, then continue without waiting.

## 2 · Plan the phase

1. Read the phase's checklist in BETA.md or FULL.md, the roadmap section it links (work packages
   `WP…`, exit criteria `E…`), the spec pages and requirement IDs they name, and the decision
   blocks of those pages.
2. Cut the phase into work packages with explicit dependencies. Fix the shared contracts first
   (Go interfaces, OpenAPI operations, database schema, chart values) so that independent packages
   can be built in parallel.
3. Assign every package to the best-fitting subagent type (table in step 3) and mark parallel
   packages. Give parallel code-writing subagents disjoint directories; where overlap is
   unavoidable, run them with `isolation: "worktree"` and merge their branches afterwards.
4. Resume rule: for a 🟡 phase, compare the checklist with the code and with `git log` since the
   last tag, keep what is done and tested, and plan only the rest.
5. Open findings: plan every finding of [section 8](#8--open-findings) as a work package of this run,
   in front of the phase's own packages. Before fixing one, reproduce it (a failing test first); a
   finding that does not reproduce is removed with a one-line reason in the commit message. Remove each
   finding from section 8 in the commit that fixes it.
6. Set the phase row and the started items to 🟡 in BETA.md or FULL.md.

## 3 · Build with subagents

Use specialized subagents wherever a task falls into their field. Brief each subagent like a peer:
goal, requirement IDs, the files or packages it owns, the contracts it must honour, the tests it
must write, the hard rules of step 0, and "do not commit or push; return a summary of changed
files and test results". If a listed type is unavailable, use `general-purpose` with the same
brief.

| Field | Subagent types |
|---|---|
| Go backend: server, storage, coordination, formats, CLI subcommands | `voltagent-lang:golang-pro`, `voltagent-core-dev:backend-developer`, `voltagent-dev-exp:cli-developer` |

| OIDC login, tokens, permissions, GitLab CI OIDC | `voltagent-infra:security-engineer`, `voltagent-core-dev:backend-developer` |
| Drains, failovers, chaos tests | `voltagent-qa-sec:chaos-engineer`, `voltagent-infra:sre-engineer` |
| Load and performance | `voltagent-qa-sec:performance-engineer` |
| Later formats | `voltagent-lang:python-pro` (PyPI), `voltagent-infra:docker-expert` (OCI and Docker), `voltagent-lang:java-architect` (Maven, Gradle), `voltagent-lang:golang-pro` (Go modules), `voltagent-infra:kubernetes-specialist` (Helm charts), `voltagent-infra:devops-engineer` (Ansible Galaxy) |
| Reviews | `voltagent-qa-sec:code-reviewer` (every phase), `voltagent-qa-sec:architect-reviewer` (contracts and structure), `voltagent-qa-sec:security-auditor` and `voltagent-qa-sec:penetration-tester` (anything that authenticates, authorizes, parses untrusted input or faces the network) |
| Failing tests and pipelines | `voltagent-qa-sec:debugger`, `voltagent-qa-sec:error-detective` |
| Documentation | `voltagent-dev-exp:documentation-engineer`, `voltagent-biz:technical-writer` |

Rules while building:

- **Tests for every registry.** Each registry needs integration tests (protocol over HTTP against
  PostgreSQL, Valkey with Sentinel and the S3 store in containers, plus the conformance kit) and
  e2e tests (its real clients against trove deployed by the Helm chart with several `web`
  replicas and random distribution, through local, remote and virtual repositories). Other code
  gets unit tests and, where it crosses PostgreSQL, Valkey or S3, integration tests.
- **Integrate continuously.** After each work package: review the diff yourself, run the task
  runner's lint, unit and integration targets, then commit one coherent change with a message
  in imperative English that names the requirement IDs, and set its checklist items to 🟢. Push
  whenever the local checks are green.
- **Design questions.** Decide them yourself. Record each one as a decision block in the
  `## Decisions` section of the owning spec page (status line "Decided by the development agent —
  selected from the options below; the owner reviews it at the walkthrough.", options table,
  choice, rationale with a revisit condition, applied edits) and add an ADR for significant ones.
  A UI question that really needs a visual reference becomes a note for the walkthrough, not a
  blocker.
- **Review before done.** Run `voltagent-qa-sec:code-reviewer` over the phase's diff, plus the
  security and architecture reviewers where the table says so. Have the fitting specialist fix
  every finding, or record why it does not apply.

## 4 · Definition of done

The phase is done only when all of the following hold:

- Every checklist item of the phase is 🟢, and every exit criterion of the roadmap section passes.
  For each exit criterion note the evidence (test name, CI job, command and output).
- Unit, integration and the per-change e2e legs are green locally and in `Test and Release`. The long legs
  (drain and failover, the npm load under faults, the soak and the performance bounds) run in
  `HA and Performance (nightly)` every night and on dispatch, not per change (owner, 2026-11-01): a phase whose
  exit criteria are long legs dispatches that workflow on its closing commit
  (`gh workflow run "HA and Performance (nightly)" --ref main`) and notes the run as evidence; any other red
  long leg becomes an open finding in [section 8](#8--open-findings) and does not hold the release.
- Documentation is current: README (naming tables; the TL;DR once trove is installable),
  docs/developer, docs/security (a page per mechanism that now exists, open gaps as `H-…` items),
  spec deviations recorded, coverage numbers regenerated.
- The white-label scan prints nothing, and `git log <previous tag>..HEAD --format=%B` contains no
  attribution trailer and no mention of an AI.
- BETA.md or FULL.md shows the phase row at 🟢 with its version, the items at 🟢, and today's date
  under **Last updated**; the [roadmap](../coverage/roadmap.md) is consistent with what was built.

## 5 · Push and get the pipeline green

1. `git push origin main`.
2. Wait for every workflow run the push triggered: `gh run list --branch main --limit 10`, then
   `gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status` for each.
3. On failure: `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`, let `voltagent-qa-sec:debugger` or the fitting
   specialist find the cause, fix it, commit, push, and wait again. Repeat until every run is
   green.

## 6 · Release

The pipeline releases; the run does not tag, create releases or write notes by hand. Semantic Release
cuts the release from the commits on `main` ([release flow](../developer/releasing.md#release-flow)),
and `Release Docker & Helm` publishes the image `guidedtraffic/trove` and the chart.

1. Commit the phase's work with conventional commit messages: `feat:` for what the phase adds, `fix:`
   for fixes, `docs:` or `chore:` for the plan and the rest. Commit the final plan update (phase row 🟢,
   Version column still open) with them.
2. Push, and wait until `Test and Release` is green on that commit. Semantic Release has then cut the
   release of the push, if the commits held a `feat` or a `fix`, and `Release Docker & Helm` has run for
   it: `gh run list --workflow "Release Docker & Helm" --limit 3`, then `gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status`.
3. Record the release that closes the phase: `git pull --rebase origin main` (the release commit moves
   `main` with the coverage badge), then the newest release (`gh release list --limit 3`) into the
   **Version** column of the phase's row in BETA.md. Commit it as `docs(plan): record vX.Y.Z as the
   release of phase N` and push. That commit cuts no release.
4. Check the published artifacts of the release: `gh release view vX.Y.Z`, the image
   `guidedtraffic/trove:X.Y.Z` on Docker Hub, and the chart index
   `https://guided-traffic.github.io/trove/index.yaml`. The release notes are generated from the commit
   messages; they name the requirement IDs, so the commits carry them (rule 4, the commit messages).

## 7 · Report to the owner

In German, short: the phase and its version; what was built; how it was verified (CI run links,
test counts, exit criteria with their evidence); the decisions taken (their IDs); deviations and
open items; the next phase.

If the run cannot finish the phase (for example because the context runs out), leave it
resumable: commit and push the finished, green work packages, keep the phase and its open items at
🟡 in the plan, and report precisely what is done and what is left. The next run picks it up.

## 8 · Open findings

Defects and gaps found outside a phase, waiting for a run (step 2, item 5). Each entry names where it
is, what was seen and how far it is confirmed: **confirmed** means checked in the code by the
development agent, **read** means found by reading the code and not reproduced. Add new findings
here; remove a finding in the commit that fixes it.

Found on 2026-11-01 while writing the manual (`docs/manual`) and the design change of Q-UI-88:

### UI defects

- **F-1 · The npm Publish tab of the client setup page is empty** (read). The npm format has no
  publish setup templates, so `/setup` shows "You cannot publish…" for npm, and for a virtual
  repository the "no default deployment target" text even when it has one. The specs do not notice,
  because the UI fake serves npm publish snippets ([fakes-packages.ts](../../web/src/app/api/testing/fakes-packages.ts)).
  Done when the server delivers the npm publish snippets (R-API-030), the fake matches the server and
  `docs/manual/user/client-setup.md` no longer says the tab has no snippet.
- **F-2 · A setup token for a virtual repository likely reads nothing** (read). **Create a token for
  this setup** scopes the token to `read` on the virtual repository only; the scope is checked against
  every member, so each package answers 404. Done when the token scope covers what the virtual
  repository resolves through, proven by a test through a virtual npm repository;
  `docs/manual/user/client-setup.md` carries a warning to remove.
- **F-9 · The token filter "Not used for (days)" matches every token** (read). The last-used time is never
  recorded. Done when the time is recorded (with a bound on write load) or the filter is removed;
  `docs/manual/admin/tokens.md` says it matches everything.
- **F-10 · System status shows a maintenance mode that does not exist** (confirmed). The handler always sets
  `MaintenanceMode = "normal"` ([handlers.go](../../internal/api/v1/handlers.go)). Done when the mode is
  real or not shown; `docs/manual/admin/limitations.md` lists it.
- **F-11 · The break-glass status shows "Enabled." without a password file** (read). Every local sign-in is
  then refused while the settings screen looks fine. Done when the status names the missing password.

### Server and API defects

- **F-12 · The saved language is not used for `/ui/` without a locale** (confirmed). `webui.Options.Preference`
  exists ([webui.go](../../internal/webui/webui.go)) but `startClient` in [app.go](../../internal/app/app.go)
  does not set it, so the browser's language wins over the stored one. Done when it is wired, with a test.
- **F-13 · The exposure check does not list stored versions** (read). The rule editor says "Versions to test
  (one per line, empty for the stored ones)" and `api/openapi.yaml` says an absent list means the stored
  versions; `ExposureService.Check` ([exposure_service.go](../../internal/authz/exposure_service.go)) judges
  only the versions sent, and `distTags` in the answer is always empty. Done when code, contract and label
  agree.

### Tests and tools

- **F-16 · No browser journey visits the help area, and the new palette has not been through the browser
  tier's colour-contrast check** (confirmed). Done when a journey opens `/help` and a page from the "?" and
  axe passes with `color-contrast` in the light (English) and the dark (German) scheme.
- **F-17 · Leftovers of old tool versions on the owner's machine that need an admin password** (confirmed).
  On 2026-11-01 helm (4.3.1), kubectl (1.37.2), docker buildx (0.38.1), kind (0.33.0) and Node.js (26.13.0)
  were brought to their pins through Homebrew, and `make versions-check` prints `versions ok`. Left: two
  shadowed copies from Docker Desktop's time in `/usr/local/bin`, `kubectl` (v1.32.2) and `kind` (v0.20.0),
  owned by root (`sudo rm /usr/local/bin/kubectl /usr/local/bin/kind`), and the Command Line Tools 26.6,
  which Homebrew reports as too old for Xcode 27
  (`sudo softwareupdate --install "Command Line Tools for Xcode 27.2-27.2"`, no restart).
  Machine-level: the owner runs these; a run does not change the machine.
